                                <p>Chris J. Murphy focuses his practice on real estate development. A partner in the firm, Chris leads the Economic Incentive Advisory, Land Use, Zoning and Redevelopment, and Government Relations practice groups.</p>

                                <p>As the leader of the firm’s Economic Incentive Advisory practice, Chris has been involved in some of New Jersey’s most high-profile corporate attraction and retention projects, and regularly assists clients in the procurement
                                    of public incentives offered through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) and other state and local government agencies.</p>

                                <p>He also represents clients in connection with the procurement of zoning, land use, and other development approvals, and regularly appears before municipal planning and zoning boards throughout New Jersey.</p>

                                <p>As a registered lobbyist, Chris provides strategic government relations counsel to developers, property owners, and businesses throughout New Jersey. With a deep understanding of how to best navigate the ever-complicated
                                    bureaucratic maze, Chris regularly works with clients to coordinate government relations efforts at the state, county, and local levels.</p>

                                <p>Prior to founding the firm, Chris spent over six years in state government, working for both the Lt. Governor and Commissioner of Labor. As part of the Lt. Governor’s Business Action Center, he advised businesses and developers
                                    through the State’s vast array of economic incentive and financing programs offered through the NJEDA and other state and local government agencies. During his time at the New Jersey Department of Labor, Chris served
                                    as manager of statewide strategic initiatives, and acted as the Department’s direct liaison to external economic development partners, including the NJEDA and Choose New Jersey. He also played a key role in the implementation
                                    and administration of the Department’s workforce development grant and incentive programs.</p>

                                <p>For over a decade, Chris has served as a trusted advisor to elected officials, policymakers, and others in the political arena. His deep understanding of New Jersey’s political landscape and government institutions, together
                                    with longstanding relationships on both sides of the political aisle, have made him a valuable advisor to many. </p>

                                <p>Chris is the co-author of the Financial Incentives Chapter of Commercial Real Estate Transactions in New Jersey (2019, 4th Edition), published by the New Jersey Institute for Continuing Legal Education, a division of the
                                    New Jersey State Bar Association. His insight on the topic of real estate incentives has been featured in both regional and national publications, including NJBIZ, Real Estate NJ, and The Wall Street Journal. </p>

                                <p>Chris received his law degree from Rutgers Law School, and a master’s degree from the Rutgers University School of Management and Labor Relations. He received his undergraduate degree, summa cum laude, from Kean University.</p>

                                <p>An avid competitor, Chris competed professionally in both ice hockey and boxing prior to starting his career as an attorney.</p>
